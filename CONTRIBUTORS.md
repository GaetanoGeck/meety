In the summer semester 2020, when Europe faced the first wave of COVID-19, I was -- as many others -- confronted with a growing number of different online meetings. Bored by the repeated searches for meeting ids and passwords, I started _Meety_ as a private project in May.

A few weeks later I told my friend and colleague Christopher Spinrath about the project, gave him access to the repository and asked for his opinion. Naive as I have been, I expected a simple feedback like "nice" (or "okay" at least). Instead, he reminded me on certain Python standards (PEP8, setuptools, ...) that I haven't been aware of. But he didn't stop at that point but rather took on and greatly improved the code -- and also started using _Meety_ himself. Many thanks to Christopher also for help and advice on the preparation of application bundles.

Early on we wanted to open source _Meety_ but due to a number of other tasks, we haven't found the time. Then, in October and November 2020, I started to rewrite large parts of _Meety_ and to add many features. You can find the product in this repository.
