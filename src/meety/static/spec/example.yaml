# SOME NOTES =========================================================
# For more detailed information on _how to specify meetings_,
# please have a look at the documentation.
#
# https://github.com/GaetanoGeck/meety/blob/main/docs/specify-meetings.md
#
# By default, "Meety" considers every YAML file (with extension
# '.yaml' or '.yml') in the user's home directory as well as in the
# current working directory.
# You can configure "Meety" not to consider all these files and/or
# other files and directories. This, again, is described in more
# detail in the documentation.
